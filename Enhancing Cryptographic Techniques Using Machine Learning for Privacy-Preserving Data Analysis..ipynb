    "\n",
    "We import the paillier module from the phe library, which is used for homomorphic encryption.\n",

    "We perform a homomorphic addition by adding encrypted_data to itself, resulting in result.\n",
    "We decrypt result using the private key, which should give us the original value (5), (54321) and (108642) .\n",
    "If the output of print(decrypted_result) is \"10,\" \"108642,\" \"217284,\". it suggests that the homomorphic addition operation (encrypted_data + encrypted_data) correctly doubled the encrypted value of (5), (54321) and (108642). This demonstrates a basic example of homomorphic encryption, where mathematical operations can be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it, preserving the privacy of the underlying data."
